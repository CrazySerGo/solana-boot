# Solana Boot
Solana Boot is a set of ansible playboot to kickstart solana nodes.
Solana Boot makes it easy to kickstart, production-grade Solana node that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Solana node and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss.

If youâ€™re looking for information about a specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier release, check out the project release notes section on our wiki.
